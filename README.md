# NLP_Sentiment_Analysis_using_RNN_and_CNN

In this project, I explored the different ML algorithms for text processing and sentiment analysis using convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks and their variants. Pre-trained word embeddings were used initially by freezing weights, and later the weights were unfreezed. Hyper parameter tuning like learning rate, batch normalization and early stopping were done to improve accuracy.
